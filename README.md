# Infinite Scroll Dog Gallery

  ( https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search?size=med&mime_types=jpg&format=json&has_breeds=true&order=RANDOM&page=0&limit=1.) This lightweight browser-based app was created to showcase dog images in a dynamic, TikTok-style feed for a professional pet photography studio.
